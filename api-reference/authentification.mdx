The MailX API uses API keys to secure all requests. Each request must include your API key in the Authorization header.

## API Keys

### Overview

API keys are unique identifiers that authenticate your requests to the MailX API. Each key has specific permissions and can be restricted to certain endpoints.

### Obtaining an API Key

1. Log in to your MailX Dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Set permissions and restrictions for the key
5. Save and copy your new API key

<Warning>
API keys are only displayed once at creation time. Store them securely as you won't be able to view them again.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

### API Key Format

Your API key will look like this:
```bash
mailx_abcdef1234567890
```

Add your API key to requests using the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: mailx_abcdef1234567890
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.mailx.tech/domains" \
     -H "Authorization: mailx_abcdef1234567890" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Rate Limiting

API keys are subject to rate limiting:

- Free tier: 100 requests/minute
- Pro tier: 1000 requests/minute
- Enterprise tier: Custom limits

<Note>
Rate limit information is included in the response headers of each request.
